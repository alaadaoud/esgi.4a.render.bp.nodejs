    name: esgi-node-app

# Notes:
# - Replace `branch` with the branch you will push (main/master).
# - Render's UI will create connection environment variables for the DB.
#   After linking the blueprint, check the service env vars in Render
#   to use the DB connection string (e.g. DATABASE_URL or a Render-provided var).
# - Tweak `plan` and `disk_gb` according to your needs and Render offerings.
